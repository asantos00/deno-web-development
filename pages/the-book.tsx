      Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with secure defaults and a
      great developer experience.
        </p>
    <p>
      “Deno Web Development” will introduce Deno’s primitives, its
      principles, and how developers can use it to build real-world
      applications.
          <br />
          The book is divided into three main sections: introducing Deno,
          building an API from scratch, and testing and deploying a Deno
          application. <br />
          The first chapters present the runtime and the motivations behind
          its creation. It explores some of the concepts introduced by Node,
          why many of them transitioned into Deno, and why new features were
          introduced.
          <br />
          After getting comfortable with Deno and why it was created, the
          reader will start to experiment with Deno, exploring the toolchain,
          and writing simple scripts and CLI applications.
          <br />
          As we transition in the second section of the book, the reader will
          start with a very simple web application and will slowly add more
          features to it.
          <br />
          This application will evolve from a simple "hello world" API to a
          web application connected to the database, with users,
          authentication, and a JavaScript.
          <br />
          By the end of it, the reader will be comfortable using Deno to build
          real-world applications.
